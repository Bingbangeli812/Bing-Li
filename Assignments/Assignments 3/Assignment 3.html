                <h4 class="highlight">What should come first, houses or museums?</h4>
                <p>Everything at once: the houses, the schools, the museums, the libraries. Urban Planning cannot ignore cultural issues. If in the construction of new neighborhoods, new housing forms the basis of the city plan (and by housing we also mean the market, the schools and the public services like the hospital and the post offices), the planning of a city cannot overlook two key public buildings that still today are considered an intellectual luxury: the Museum and the Library.</p>

                <h4 class="highlight">Museum? What is a museum?</h4>
                <p>In everyday life, when we want to describe a person, thing or idea that is outdated, not practical or useful, we often say ‘they belong in a museum’. The expression is a clear indicator of the place museums occupy in contemporary culture, the perception of them as dusty, useless spaces. Sometimes museums are merely the stage for the exhibitionist antics of architects who, rather than designing them to showcase the ‘pieces’, create complex confections with a decorative character that gets in the way of the ‘museology’...</p>

                <p>The problem of the museum has to be tackled today on ‘didactic’ and ‘technical’ grounds. These foundations are essential if the museum is not to become petrified, that is, entirely useless. A museum cannot exist in isolation from its time. If we isolate a work of art, even when it's presented with the most advanced techniques, without connecting it to our present moment and historical context, the visitor, especially the younger ones, will only see it as a disconnected object of curiosity. Without deeper understanding, these objects remain aesthetically interesting but historically silent.</p>

                <p>A museum that ought to have its own didactic voice in order to become a ‘true’ museum, which is ‘alive’, and not a ‘museum’ in the most obsolete use of the term.</p>

                <p>The experience gained with the São Paulo Museum of Art demonstrated the importance of engaging the visitor not only with historical works but also with their relevance to contemporary issues...</p>

                <p>These considerations are critical as Bahia stands on the brink of creating what could become one of the most important museums in the country: the Santa Teresa Museum of Sacred Art, with its collection and the poetic beauty of its setting.</p>
